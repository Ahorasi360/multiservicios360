## ARTICLE XIV — WITHDRAWAL AND RESIGNATION

**Section 14.1. Voluntary Withdrawal.** No Member shall have the right to voluntarily withdraw or resign from the Company prior to the dissolution and winding up of the Company, except with the prior written consent of a Majority in Interest of the remaining Members. Any Member who withdraws in violation of this Section shall be liable to the Company and the remaining Members for any damages caused by such withdrawal, including, without limitation, any loss of business, expense, or damage resulting therefrom.

**Section 14.2. Effect of Withdrawal.** Upon a permitted withdrawal, the withdrawing Member shall be entitled to receive, within a reasonable time after the effective date of withdrawal, the fair market value of such Member's Membership Interest as of the date of withdrawal, as determined in good faith by the {{management_reference}} or, if the parties cannot agree, by an independent appraiser selected by the {{management_reference}} and the withdrawing Member.

**Section 14.3. Payment Terms.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and the withdrawing Member, the Company may pay the fair market value of the withdrawing Member's Membership Interest in up to twelve (12) equal monthly installments, commencing within sixty (60) days following the effective date of withdrawal, together with interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of the applicable federal rate under Section 1274(d) of the Code.

**Section 14.4. Continuing Obligations.** Any Member who withdraws from the Company shall remain bound by: (a) the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement; and (b) any other obligations under this Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive withdrawal. The withdrawal of a Member shall not release such Member from any obligation or liability incurred prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

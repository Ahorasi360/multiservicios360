## ARTICLE XV — DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP

**Section 15.1. Events of Dissolution.** The Company shall be dissolved upon the first to occur of the following events:

**(a)** The unanimous written consent of all Members to dissolve the Company;

**(b)** The entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 17707.03 of the Act;

**(c)** The occurrence of any event that makes it unlawful for the Company's business to be continued; or

**(d)** Any other event specified in the Articles of Organization or required by the Act as a cause for dissolution.

The death, Bankruptcy, dissolution, or withdrawal of any Member shall not, in and of itself, cause the dissolution of the Company, and the Company shall continue in existence following any such event.

**Section 15.2. Winding Up.** Upon dissolution of the Company, the {{management_reference}} (or, if there is no {{management_reference}}, a liquidating agent appointed by a Majority in Interest of the Members) shall wind up the Company's affairs. The winding up shall include: (a) the orderly liquidation of the Company's assets; (b) the application and distribution of the proceeds thereof; and (c) the filing of a Certificate of Cancellation with the California Secretary of State. The Person winding up the Company's affairs shall have full power and authority to sell, assign, and encumber any or all of the Company's assets in order to provide for the payment of liabilities and the distribution of remaining assets.

**Section 15.3. Order of Distribution.** Upon the winding up of the Company, the assets of the Company shall be distributed in the following order of priority:

**(a)** First, to creditors of the Company (including Members who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law) in satisfaction of the liabilities of the Company, whether by payment or by establishment of adequate reserves, in the order of priority as provided by law;

**(b)** Second, to the establishment of any reserves that the {{management_reference}} or liquidating agent deems reasonably necessary for any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Company, which reserves shall be held for such period as the {{management_reference}} or liquidating agent shall deem advisable and thereafter distributed in accordance with this Section;

**(c)** Third, to the Members in proportion to and to the extent of the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and allocations for all periods; and

**(d)** Fourth, the balance, if any, to the Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.

**Section 15.4. No Obligation to Restore Deficit.** No Member shall be required to restore a deficit balance in such Member's Capital Account upon dissolution of the Company. The deficit balance, if any, of any Member's Capital Account shall not be considered an asset of the Company.

**Section 15.5. Distributions in Kind.** In connection with the winding up of the Company, the {{management_reference}} or liquidating agent may distribute Company assets in kind to the Members rather than first converting such assets to cash, provided that the fair market value of any property distributed in kind is determined by the {{management_reference}} or liquidating agent in good faith and each Member receives the same proportion of any property distributed in kind as such Member would have received if such property had been sold for its fair market value and the net proceeds distributed in cash.

**Section 15.6. Filing of Certificate of Cancellation.** Upon completion of the winding up of the Company, the {{management_reference}} or liquidating agent shall file a Certificate of Cancellation with the California Secretary of State and take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to terminate the Company.

**Section 15.7. Reasonable Time for Winding Up.** A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its assets in order to minimize any losses attendant upon such winding up.

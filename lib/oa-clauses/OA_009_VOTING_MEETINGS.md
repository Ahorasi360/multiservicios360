## ARTICLE VII — VOTING AND MEETINGS

**Section 7.1. Voting Rights.** Each Member shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members. Each Member's voting power shall be proportional to such Member's Percentage Interest. Except as otherwise required by this Agreement or the Act, all matters submitted to a vote of the Members shall be decided by a Majority in Interest.

**Section 7.2. Action by Written Consent.** Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by Members having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Written consent may be delivered by electronic transmission, including email, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The {{management_reference}} shall give prompt notice of the taking of any action by written consent to those Members who did not consent in writing to such action.

**Section 7.3. Meetings.** Meetings of the Members may be called by the {{management_reference}} or by any Member or Members holding at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total Percentage Interests. Written notice of any meeting shall be given to all Members not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice shall state the date, time, place (which may include electronic means), and purpose of the meeting.

**Section 7.4. Quorum.** The presence, in person or by proxy, of Members holding a Majority in Interest shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Members. If a quorum is not present at any meeting, the Members present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present.

**Section 7.5. Proxies.** A Member may vote at any meeting by a written proxy signed by such Member and delivered to the {{management_reference}} at or prior to the meeting. A proxy shall be revocable by the Member granting it at any time before the vote pursuant to the proxy is taken by filing a notice of revocation with the {{management_reference}}.

**Section 7.6. Telephonic and Electronic Meetings.** Members may participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone, videoconference, or any similar communications equipment by means of which all Persons participating in the meeting can hear and communicate with each other. Participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

## ARTICLE V — CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

**Section 5.1. Initial Capital Contributions.** Each Member has made or shall make the initial Capital Contribution to the Company in the amount and form set forth opposite such Member's name in Schedule A attached hereto. The initial Capital Contributions shall be made on or before the date set forth in Schedule A or, if no date is set forth, within thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement.

**Section 5.2. Additional Capital Contributions.** No Member shall be required to make any additional Capital Contribution to the Company beyond such Member's initial Capital Contribution, except as may be unanimously agreed upon in writing by all Members. Any additional Capital Contributions shall be made in such amounts, at such times, and upon such terms as may be determined by the unanimous written consent of the Members. If additional Capital Contributions are agreed upon, Schedule A shall be amended to reflect the adjusted Capital Contributions and any corresponding adjustment to Percentage Interests.

**Section 5.3. Failure to Contribute.** If any Member fails to make a required Capital Contribution within the time period specified, the {{management_reference}} may, without limiting any other rights or remedies available under this Agreement or applicable law: (a) cause the Company to advance the amount of the delinquent contribution as a loan to such Member, bearing interest at the lesser of ten percent (10%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; (b) permit the other Members to contribute the additional amount, with a corresponding adjustment to the Percentage Interests of all Members; or (c) pursue any other remedy available at law or in equity.

**Section 5.4. No Interest on Contributions.** No Member shall be entitled to receive interest on such Member's Capital Contribution except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

**Section 5.5. Return of Contributions.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Member shall have the right to withdraw or receive a return of such Member's Capital Contribution. No Member shall have priority over any other Member with respect to the return of Capital Contributions, distributions, or allocations, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

**Section 5.6. Form of Contributions.** Capital Contributions may be made in cash or, with the approval of the {{management_reference}}, in the form of property or services. Any non-cash Capital Contribution shall be valued at its fair market value as of the date of contribution, as determined in good faith by the {{management_reference}}.

**Section 5.7. Capital Accounts.** An individual Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Member in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Each Member's Capital Account shall be: (a) credited with the amount of such Member's Capital Contributions, such Member's allocable share of Company net profits, and any other items of income or gain allocated to such Member; and (b) debited with the amount of any distributions to such Member, such Member's allocable share of Company net losses, and any other items of loss or deduction allocated to such Member. The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulation.

## ARTICLE XXII — BUY-SELL AND BUYOUT PROVISIONS

**Section 22.1. Triggering Events.** The buy-sell provisions of this Article shall apply upon the occurrence of any of the following events with respect to a Member (each, a "Triggering Event"): (a) the death of a Member (or, if a Member is a trust, the death of the primary beneficiary); (b) the permanent disability of a Member (as defined in Section 22.8); (c) the Bankruptcy of a Member; (d) the entry of a court order charging a Member's Membership Interest; (e) the divorce of a Member pursuant to which a court orders the Transfer of all or a portion of such Member's Membership Interest; or (f) the termination of a Member's employment with the Company, if applicable.

**Section 22.2. Company Purchase Option.** Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Company shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Membership Interest of the affected Member (the "Selling Member") at the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 22.5). The Company shall exercise this right by delivering written notice to the Selling Member (or the Selling Member's legal representative, estate, or successor) within sixty (60) days following the date on which the Company receives written notice of the Triggering Event.

**Section 22.3. Member Purchase Option.** If the Company does not exercise its purchase right within the sixty (60) day period described in Section 22.2, the remaining Members shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the Selling Member's Membership Interest at the Purchase Price, pro rata in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests (or in such other proportions as the purchasing Members may agree among themselves). Each remaining Member shall exercise this right by delivering written notice to the Selling Member (or the Selling Member's legal representative, estate, or successor) within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Company's option period.

**Section 22.4. Over-Allotment.** If any remaining Member elects not to purchase its full pro rata share, the other purchasing Members shall have the right, for an additional fifteen (15) days, to purchase the unpurchased portion of the Selling Member's Membership Interest, pro rata in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests, until all of the Selling Member's Membership Interest has been purchased or no purchasing Member desires to purchase additional interests.

**Section 22.5. Purchase Price.** The purchase price for a Selling Member's Membership Interest (the "Purchase Price") shall be the fair market value of such Membership Interest as of the date of the Triggering Event, determined as follows:

**(a) Agreed Value.** If the Members have established an agreed value for the Membership Interests within the twelve (12) months preceding the Triggering Event (the "Agreed Value"), the Purchase Price shall be the Selling Member's pro rata share of the Agreed Value based on such Member's Percentage Interest.

**(b) Appraisal.** If no current Agreed Value exists, the fair market value shall be determined by an independent appraiser selected by mutual agreement of the purchasing party and the Selling Member (or such Member's legal representative). If the parties cannot agree on an appraiser within fifteen (15) days, each party shall select one appraiser, and the two appointed appraisers shall select a third appraiser. The fair market value shall be determined by the third appraiser (or, if no third appraiser is selected, the average of the two appraisals). The cost of any appraisal shall be borne equally by the purchasing party and the Selling Member.

**(c) Valuation Standards.** Any appraisal shall be conducted using the fair market value standard, taking into account appropriate discounts for lack of marketability and minority interest (if applicable), and shall value the Company as a going concern.

**Section 22.6. Payment Terms.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Purchase Price shall be paid as follows:

**(a)** A down payment equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price, payable at closing;

**(b)** The balance of the Purchase Price shall be payable in equal monthly installments over a period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months following the closing, together with interest on the unpaid balance at the applicable federal rate under Section 1274(d) of the Code as of the date of the Triggering Event;

**(c)** The purchasing party shall have the right to prepay the balance of the Purchase Price at any time without penalty; and

**(d)** The obligation to pay the Purchase Price shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by the purchasing party in favor of the Selling Member.

**Section 22.7. Closing.** The closing of any purchase pursuant to this Article shall take place within thirty (30) days following the determination of the Purchase Price (or such later date as the parties may agree). At the closing, the Selling Member shall deliver to the purchasing party such instruments of transfer and other documents as the purchasing party may reasonably request, and the purchasing party shall deliver to the Selling Member the down payment and promissory note as described in Section 22.6.

**Section 22.8. Definition of Permanent Disability.** For purposes of this Article, "permanent disability" means the inability of a Member, due to physical or mental impairment, to perform the essential functions of such Member's duties to the Company for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days, or for an aggregate of two hundred seventy (270) days during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, as certified by a licensed physician selected by the {{management_reference}}.

**Section 22.9. Life Insurance.** The Company may, at its option and expense, obtain and maintain life insurance policies on the lives of the Members in such amounts as the {{management_reference}} deems appropriate to fund the Company's obligations under this Article. Each Member agrees to cooperate fully with the Company in obtaining such insurance, including submitting to medical examinations and completing insurance applications. Any life insurance proceeds received by the Company shall be applied first toward the purchase of the deceased Member's Membership Interest.

**Section 22.10. Failure to Exercise.** If neither the Company nor the remaining Members exercise their purchase rights within the time periods specified in this Article, the Selling Member (or the Selling Member's legal representative, estate, or successor) shall continue to hold the Membership Interest subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

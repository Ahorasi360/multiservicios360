## ARTICLE VI — MANAGEMENT

**Section 6.1. Management by Members.** The Company shall be member-managed. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the management and control of the Company and its business and affairs shall be vested in the Members, acting by a Majority in Interest, who shall have the full and exclusive right, power, and authority to manage, control, administer, and operate the business and affairs of the Company and to make all decisions affecting such business and affairs, including, without limitation, the power and authority to take any action that is not specifically reserved to the Members by other provisions of this Agreement or by the Act.

**Section 6.2. Authority of Members.** Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, each Member shall be an agent of the Company for the purpose of its business and affairs. The act of any Member, including the execution of any instrument in the name of the Company, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course of the Company's business or business of the kind carried on by the Company shall bind the Company, unless: (a) the Member so acting has in fact no authority to act for the Company in the particular matter; and (b) the Person with whom the Member is dealing has knowledge of the fact that the Member has no such authority.

**Section 6.3. Actions Requiring Unanimous Consent.** Notwithstanding Section 6.1, the following actions shall require the unanimous written consent of all Members: (a) the merger, conversion, or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity; (b) the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (c) the voluntary dissolution and winding up of the Company; (d) any amendment to this Agreement; (e) the admission of a new Member to the Company; (f) the incurrence of indebtedness in excess of {{debt_threshold}} in any single transaction or series of related transactions; (g) any transaction between the Company and any Member or Affiliate of a Member; (h) the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or the consent to an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding; and (i) any change to the purpose of the Company as set forth in this Agreement.

**Section 6.4. Duties of Members.** Each Member shall devote such time and effort to the business and affairs of the Company as such Member, in such Member's reasonable discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to manage and operate the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any Member from engaging in or possessing an interest in any other business, venture, investment, or activity of any nature and description, independently or with others, whether or not such business, venture, investment, or activity is competitive with the Company's business.

**Section 6.5. Officers.** The Members, acting by a Majority in Interest, may designate one or more Persons to serve as officers of the Company with such titles, authority, and duties as the Members may determine from time to time. Any officer may be removed by the Members, acting by a Majority in Interest, at any time, with or without cause. The designation of an officer shall not, in and of itself, create any contractual right to continued service or compensation.

**Section 6.6. Compensation.** No Member shall be entitled to receive any salary, fee, or other compensation for services rendered to the Company in such Member's capacity as a Member, except as may be approved by a Majority in Interest. Members may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the conduct of the Company's business upon submission of appropriate documentation.

**Section 6.7. Reliance by Third Parties.** Any Person dealing with the Company may rely upon the authority of any Member to take any action on behalf of the Company without inquiry into the provisions of this Agreement or compliance herewith, regardless of whether that action actually is taken in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

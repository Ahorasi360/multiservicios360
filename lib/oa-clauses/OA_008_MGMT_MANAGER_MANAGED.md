**Section 6.1. Management by Manager(s).** The Company shall be manager-managed. The management and control of the Company and its business and affairs shall be vested exclusively in the Manager(s). The initial Manager(s) of the Company shall be as set forth in Schedule B attached hereto. The Manager(s) shall have the full and exclusive right, power, and authority to manage, control, administer, and operate the business and affairs of the Company and to make all decisions affecting such business and affairs, including, without limitation, the power and authority to execute documents, enter into contracts, hire employees, open and maintain bank accounts, borrow money, and take any and all actions that the Manager(s) deem necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Company's business.

**Section 6.2. Appointment and Removal of Managers.** The Manager(s) shall be appointed and may be removed by a Majority in Interest of the Members. A Manager may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote or written consent of a Majority in Interest of the Members. A Manager may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Members. Any vacancy in the position of Manager shall be filled by a Majority in Interest of the Members.

**Section 6.3. Number of Managers.** The Company shall have {{manager_count}} Manager(s). The number of Managers may be increased or decreased from time to time by a Majority in Interest of the Members, but in no event shall the number be less than one (1).

**Section 6.4. Authority of Managers.** Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, each Manager shall be an agent of the Company for the purpose of its business and affairs. The act of any Manager, including the execution of any instrument in the name of the Company, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course of the Company's business or business of the kind carried on by the Company shall bind the Company. No Member, in such Member's capacity as a Member, shall have any authority or power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do any act that would be binding on the Company, or to incur any expenditure on behalf of the Company.

**Section 6.5. Actions Requiring Member Approval.** Notwithstanding Section 6.1, the following actions shall require the prior written approval of a Majority in Interest of the Members (or unanimous consent where indicated): (a) the merger, conversion, or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity (unanimous); (b) the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets (unanimous); (c) the voluntary dissolution and winding up of the Company (unanimous); (d) any amendment to this Agreement (unanimous); (e) the admission of a new Member to the Company (unanimous); (f) the incurrence of indebtedness in excess of {{debt_threshold}} in any single transaction or series of related transactions (Majority in Interest); (g) any transaction between the Company and any Manager, Member, or Affiliate thereof (Majority in Interest of disinterested Members); and (h) the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy (unanimous).

**Section 6.6. Duties of Managers.** Each Manager shall devote such time and effort to the business and affairs of the Company as such Manager, in such Manager's reasonable judgment, deems necessary for the proper conduct of the Company's business. Each Manager shall discharge such Manager's duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the Manager reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any Manager from engaging in or possessing an interest in any other business, venture, investment, or activity of any nature and description, independently or with others.

**Section 6.7. Officers.** The Manager(s) may designate one or more Persons to serve as officers of the Company with such titles, authority, and duties as the Manager(s) may determine from time to time. Any officer may be removed by the Manager(s) at any time, with or without cause.

**Section 6.9. Reliance by Third Parties.** Any Person dealing with the Company may rely upon the authority of any Manager to take any action on behalf of the Company without inquiry into the provisions of this Agreement or compliance herewith.

**Section 6.10. Managers Who Are Members.** A Manager who is also a Member shall have all the rights and obligations of both a Manager and a Member. Such Person's rights and obligations as a Manager shall be distinct from such Person's rights and obligations as a Member.

## ARTICLE XXXII — COUNTERPARTS AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES

**Section 32.1. Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary that any single counterpart be signed by all parties hereto, provided that each party signs at least one counterpart.

**Section 32.2. Electronic Signatures.** This Agreement and any amendment, supplement, or modification hereto may be executed and delivered by electronic signature (including any electronic signature complying with the California Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code Sections 1633.1 et seq., or the federal ESIGN Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001-7006) and by facsimile or electronic transmission (including email in portable document format (.pdf)), and such electronic signature, facsimile, or electronic transmission shall be valid and binding on the party executing the same to the same extent as if such party had executed an original counterpart of this Agreement.

**Section 32.3. Electronic Records.** The Members agree that this Agreement and any notices, consents, approvals, or other communications given or made pursuant to this Agreement may be created, delivered, and stored in electronic form to the extent permitted by applicable law.

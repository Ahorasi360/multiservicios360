## ARTICLE XXXIII — FORCE MAJEURE

**Section 33.1. Force Majeure Event.** No Member shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement (other than an obligation to make a monetary payment) to the extent that such failure or delay results from a Force Majeure Event. A "Force Majeure Event" means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Member, including: (a) acts of God, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, or other natural disasters; (b) epidemics, pandemics, or quarantine restrictions; (c) war, invasion, hostilities, terrorist threats or acts, riot, or other civil unrest; (d) government order, law, or actions; (e) embargoes or blockades; (f) national or regional emergency; (g) strikes, labor stoppages, or slowdowns; (h) fire, explosion, or other physical destruction of essential facilities; or (i) power outages, internet or telecommunications failures, or cyberattacks.

**Section 33.2. Notice and Mitigation.** The affected Member shall: (a) promptly notify the other Members and the {{management_reference}} in writing of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event; and (c) resume performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the cessation of the Force Majeure Event.

**Section 33.3. Prolonged Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, any Member may, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Members, request that the Members meet to discuss in good faith any modifications to this Agreement or to the Company's business operations that may be necessary or appropriate in light of the Force Majeure Event, including the possible dissolution of the Company.

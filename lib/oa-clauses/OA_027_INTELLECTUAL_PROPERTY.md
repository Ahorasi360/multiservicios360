## ARTICLE XXIV — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**Section 24.1. Company Intellectual Property.** All intellectual property created, developed, conceived, or reduced to practice by any Member, Manager, officer, employee, or contractor in the course of performing services for or on behalf of the Company, or using the Company's resources, facilities, or Confidential Information, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company ("Company IP"). Company IP includes, without limitation, all patents, patent applications, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, know-how, software, data, designs, drawings, processes, formulas, and all other intellectual property rights and proprietary information.

**Section 24.2. Assignment.** Each Member hereby irrevocably assigns and agrees to assign to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to any Company IP, including all intellectual property rights therein, without further consideration. Each Member shall execute and deliver to the Company such instruments and documents as the Company may reasonably request to evidence, perfect, or record such assignment, including assignments of patents, copyrights, and trademarks.

**Section 24.3. Pre-Existing Intellectual Property.** Nothing in this Article shall affect the ownership of intellectual property that a Member owned prior to becoming a Member of the Company or that a Member develops entirely on such Member's own time without use of the Company's resources, facilities, or Confidential Information, and that is unrelated to the Company's business ("Pre-Existing IP"). Each Member shall identify any Pre-Existing IP that such Member intends to use in connection with the Company's business, and any such use shall be subject to a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license granted by such Member to the Company for use in connection with the Company's business.

**Section 24.4. Moral Rights.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Member irrevocably waives any and all moral rights or rights of attribution or integrity that such Member may have in any Company IP.

**Section 24.5. California Labor Code Acknowledgment.** The Members acknowledge that, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 2870, the provisions of this Article requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to any invention that a Member develops entirely on such Member's own time without using the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information, except for those inventions that: (a) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice to the Company's business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development; or (b) result from any work performed by such Member for the Company.

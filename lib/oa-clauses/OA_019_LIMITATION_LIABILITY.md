## ARTICLE XVII — LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

**Section 17.1. Limitation of Liability.** To the fullest extent permitted by the Act and other applicable law, no Member, Manager, officer, employee, or agent of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or to any Member for any act or omission performed or omitted by such Person in good faith on behalf of the Company and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Person by this Agreement, except for any act or omission resulting from such Person's fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional violation of law.

**Section 17.2. Reliance.** Each Member, Manager, and officer of the Company shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports, or statements presented to the Company by any Person as to matters the Member, Manager, or officer reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence, including information, opinions, reports, or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to Members might properly be paid.

**Section 17.3. No Fiduciary Duties to Third Parties.** No Member or Manager shall owe any fiduciary duty or other duty to any creditor of the Company with respect to any asset of the Company. The creditors of the Company shall have no right to compel any distribution or other payment from the Company or any Member.

**Section 17.4. Exculpation.** No Member, Manager, or officer of the Company shall be liable, responsible, or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Company or to any Member for any error of judgment, mistake of fact or law, or any act or omission, as long as such Person acted in good faith for a purpose that such Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company, and provided that such conduct did not constitute fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional violation of law.

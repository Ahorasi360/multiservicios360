## ARTICLE XXX — SEVERABILITY

**Section 30.1. Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable to any extent by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect.

**Section 30.2. Reformation.** If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties agree that such provision shall be reformed and construed so that it would be valid, legal, and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, while most nearly preserving the original intent of the parties. If such provision cannot be so reformed, it shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

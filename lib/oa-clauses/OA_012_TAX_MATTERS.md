## ARTICLE X — TAX MATTERS

**Section 10.1. Tax Classification.** The Members intend that the Company shall be treated as {{tax_classification_text}} for federal and state income tax purposes. The {{management_reference}} shall not take any action or make any election that would cause the Company to be classified other than as intended without the unanimous written consent of all Members.

**Section 10.2. Tax Returns.** The {{management_reference}} shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all tax returns required to be filed by the Company, including federal, state, and local tax returns. The {{management_reference}} shall furnish to each Member a copy of each such return, or a Schedule K-1 (or equivalent information), within seventy-five (75) days after the close of each Fiscal Year, or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.

**Section 10.3. Partnership Representative.** {{tax_matters_member_name}} is hereby designated as the Partnership Representative (as defined in Section 6223 of the Code, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) of the Company. The Partnership Representative shall have all of the rights and authority granted to a partnership representative under the Code and the Treasury Regulations. The Partnership Representative shall keep the other Members informed of any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the determination of Company items at the Company level and shall not take any action with respect to such proceedings without first consulting with the other Members, provided that the Partnership Representative shall have the ultimate authority to make all decisions on behalf of the Company with respect to such proceedings. If the Company is subject to any imputed underpayment under Section 6225 of the Code, the Partnership Representative shall use reasonable efforts to make the election under Section 6226 of the Code to push out adjustments to the Members, unless a Majority in Interest of the Members determines otherwise.

**Section 10.4. Tax Elections.** The {{management_reference}} shall make the following elections on the appropriate tax returns:

**(a)** To adopt the calendar year as the Company's Fiscal Year, unless otherwise required by the Code;

**(b)** To adopt the method of accounting that the {{management_reference}} determines is most advantageous to the Company and the Members;

**(c)** If there is a distribution of Company property as described in Section 734 of the Code, or if there is a Transfer of a Membership Interest as described in Section 743 of the Code, upon written request of any Member, to elect, pursuant to Section 754 of the Code, to adjust the basis of Company property; and

**(d)** To make any other election the {{management_reference}} may deem appropriate and in the best interest of the Members.

**Section 10.5. Tax Matters Expenses.** The Company shall pay and be responsible for all reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred in connection with any tax audit, investigation, settlement, or litigation relating to the tax affairs of the Company.

## ARTICLE XVI — INDEMNIFICATION

**Section 16.1. Indemnification.** To the fullest extent permitted by the Act and other applicable law, the Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Member, each Manager (if any), and each officer, employee, and agent of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation and defense), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative) in which such Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise by reason of such Indemnified Person's status as a Member, Manager, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or by reason of any action or inaction on such Indemnified Person's part while serving in such capacity; provided, however, that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent that such Losses resulted from such Indemnified Person's fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional violation of law.

**Section 16.2. Advance of Expenses.** The Company shall pay the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of expenses in advance shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article.

**Section 16.3. Insurance.** The {{management_reference}} may cause the Company to purchase and maintain insurance, at the Company's expense, to protect the Company and any Indemnified Person against any Losses, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such Indemnified Person against such Losses under the provisions of this Article.

**Section 16.4. Non-Exclusivity.** The indemnification provided by this Article shall be in addition to any other rights to which any Indemnified Person may be entitled under any agreement, as a matter of law, or otherwise, both as to action in the Indemnified Person's capacity as a Member, Manager, officer, employee, or agent and as to action in any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns, and administrators of such Indemnified Person.

**Section 16.5. Savings Clause.** If any provision of this Article is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

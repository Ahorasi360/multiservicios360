## ARTICLE IX — DISTRIBUTIONS

**Section 9.1. Distributions of Distributable Cash.** Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement and applicable law, the {{management_reference}} may, in its sole discretion, cause the Company to distribute Distributable Cash to the Members from time to time as the {{management_reference}} shall determine. Such distributions shall be made to the Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests unless otherwise agreed in writing by all Members.

**Section 9.2. Tax Distributions.** To the extent the Company has Distributable Cash available, the {{management_reference}} shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to distribute to each Member, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for estimated tax payments (including any extensions) and the due date for annual tax returns, an amount at least equal to such Member's estimated tax liability arising from the Company's income allocated to such Member for the applicable period. For purposes of this Section, a Member's estimated tax liability shall be calculated by multiplying such Member's allocable share of the Company's net taxable income by the highest combined federal and California income tax rate applicable to individuals for the relevant period. Tax distributions shall be treated as advances against future distributions and shall reduce the amount of subsequent distributions to such Member.

**Section 9.3. Limitations on Distributions.** No distribution shall be made to any Member if, after giving effect to such distribution: (a) the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the Company's activities; or (b) the Company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless this Agreement provides otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights of other Members upon dissolution and winding up that are superior to the rights of the Member receiving the distribution. The {{management_reference}} may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under this Section on any of the following: financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the circumstances, a fair valuation, or any other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.

**Section 9.4. No Right to Demand Distributions.** No Member shall have the right to demand or receive any distribution from the Company in any form other than cash except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. No Member may withdraw any portion of such Member's Capital Account or receive any distribution from the Company except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.

**Section 9.5. Distributions in Kind.** The {{management_reference}} may make distributions in kind. Any property distributed in kind shall be valued at its fair market value as of the date of distribution, as determined in good faith by the {{management_reference}}. Each Member's Capital Account shall be adjusted as if such distributed property had been sold for its fair market value and the net proceeds thereof distributed to the Members.

**Section 9.6. Withholding.** The Company is authorized to withhold from distributions, or with respect to allocations, to the Members and to pay over to any federal, state, or local government any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to the Code or any provisions of any other federal, state, or local law. Any amounts so withheld with respect to any Member shall be treated as a distribution to such Member for all purposes of this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XXI — DISPUTE RESOLUTION

**Section 21.1. Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (a "Dispute"), the parties involved in such Dispute shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute through direct negotiation. Either party may initiate such negotiation by delivering written notice to the other party describing the Dispute in reasonable detail (a "Dispute Notice"). Within fifteen (15) days following receipt of a Dispute Notice, the parties shall meet (in person or by videoconference) and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute.

**Section 21.2. Mediation.** If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through direct negotiation within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Dispute Notice, either party may submit the Dispute to mediation administered by JAMS or another mutually agreed-upon mediation service in the County of {{mediation_county}}, California. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the then-current JAMS Mediation Rules and Procedures. The parties shall share equally the costs of the mediator and the mediation, and each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in connection with the mediation. The mediator shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California with experience in business and corporate matters.

**Section 21.3. Arbitration.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days following submission to mediation (or such longer period as the parties may agree), the Dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in the County of {{arbitration_county}}, California, in accordance with the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California with at least ten (10) years of experience in business and corporate law.

**Section 21.4. Arbitration Procedures.** The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order, including temporary or permanent injunctive relief, specific performance, and monetary damages. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision setting forth the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the award is based. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages except to the extent that such damages are expressly authorized by an applicable statute.

**Section 21.5. Costs and Fees.** The prevailing party in any arbitration proceeding (as determined by the arbitrator) shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration, in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled. The costs of the arbitrator and the arbitration shall be allocated by the arbitrator.

**Section 21.6. Confidentiality of Proceedings.** All negotiations, mediations, and arbitrations conducted pursuant to this Article, including any settlements, awards, and related documents, shall be treated as confidential by the parties and shall not be disclosed to any third party except: (a) as necessary to enforce any settlement or award; (b) as required by applicable law; or (c) with the prior written consent of all parties to the Dispute.

**Section 21.7. Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article shall prevent any party from seeking temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, pending resolution of any Dispute through the procedures set forth in this Article.

**Section 21.8. Continuation of Business.** During the pendency of any Dispute, the Members shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and shall continue to operate the Company's business in the ordinary course.

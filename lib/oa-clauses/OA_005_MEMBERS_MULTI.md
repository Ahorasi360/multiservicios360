## ARTICLE IV — MEMBERS

**Section 4.1. Members.** The names, addresses, Capital Contributions, and Percentage Interests of the Members of the Company are set forth in Schedule A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Members acknowledge and agree that their respective Percentage Interests accurately reflect each Member's proportionate share of the total Membership Interests in the Company as of the effective date of this Agreement.

**Section 4.2. Limited Liability.** No Member shall be personally liable for any debt, obligation, or liability of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, solely by reason of being a Member of the Company. The failure of the Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or the management of its business or affairs shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability on any Member for liabilities of the Company.

**Section 4.3. No Authority to Bind.** Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Member shall have the authority or power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do any act that would be binding on the Company, or to incur any expenditure on behalf of the Company. Any Member who takes any action or binds the Company in violation of this Section shall be solely responsible for any loss or expense incurred by the Company as a result of such unauthorized action.

**Section 4.4. Representations and Warranties.** Each Member hereby represents and warrants to the Company and to each other Member that: (a) such Member has the legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform such Member's obligations hereunder; (b) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of such Member, enforceable against such Member in accordance with its terms; (c) such Member's Membership Interest in the Company is being acquired for investment purposes only and not with a view toward the resale or distribution thereof; and (d) such Member has had the opportunity to consult with independent legal counsel regarding the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

**Section 4.5. Duties Among Members.** Each Member shall deal with the Company and the other Members in good faith. No Member shall take any action that is intended to harm the Company or the economic interests of any other Member. Each Member acknowledges that the other Members may have business interests and activities in addition to those relating to the Company, and nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any Member from engaging in such other business interests and activities.

## ARTICLE XI — TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

**Section 11.1. General Restriction on Transfer.** No Member shall Transfer all or any portion of such Member's Membership Interest except in compliance with this Article and applicable law. Any purported Transfer in violation of this Article shall be null and void and of no force or effect, and the Company shall not recognize or give effect to such Transfer on the books and records of the Company.

**Section 11.2. Conditions to Transfer.** A Member may Transfer all or any portion of such Member's Membership Interest only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

**(a)** The transferring Member provides at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the {{management_reference}} and all other Members, which notice shall include the identity of the proposed transferee, the terms of the proposed Transfer, and such other information as the {{management_reference}} may reasonably request;

**(b)** The Transfer complies with the right of first refusal provisions set forth in this Agreement, if applicable;

**(c)** The prior written consent of a Majority in Interest of the non-transferring Members is obtained, which consent may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of such Members;

**(d)** The Transfer would not cause the Company to be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code;

**(e)** The Transfer would not violate any applicable federal or state securities laws;

**(f)** The transferee executes and delivers to the Company such instruments and documents as the {{management_reference}} deems necessary or appropriate, including a written agreement to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and

**(g)** The transferring Member or the transferee pays all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the Transfer.

**Section 11.3. Permitted Transfers.** Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, a Member may Transfer all or any portion of such Member's Membership Interest without the consent of the other Members to: (a) a revocable trust established by such Member for estate planning purposes, of which such Member is the primary beneficiary and trustee; (b) any spouse, parent, child, or grandchild of such Member (collectively, "Immediate Family Members"); or (c) an entity wholly owned by such Member or such Member's Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that in each case: (i) the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) the Transfer complies with applicable securities laws.

**Section 11.4. Effect of Transfer.** A Transfer of a Membership Interest shall not dissolve or require the winding up of the Company. Upon a Transfer in compliance with this Article, the transferee shall be admitted as a Member of the Company and shall succeed to all of the rights, powers, and obligations of the transferring Member with respect to the Membership Interest so Transferred. Schedule A shall be amended to reflect any Transfer made in accordance with this Article.

**Section 11.5. Involuntary Transfers.** In the event of any involuntary Transfer of a Member's Membership Interest (including by reason of Bankruptcy, divorce decree, court order, or operation of law), the Company and the remaining Members shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the Membership Interest so Transferred at fair market value, as determined in accordance with this Agreement.

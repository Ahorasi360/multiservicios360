## ARTICLE XX — NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION

**Section 20.1. Non-Competition.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, including California Business and Professions Code Sections 16600 et seq., each Member agrees that, during the period in which such Member holds a Membership Interest in the Company, such Member shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, participate in, or be connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation, or control of any business that directly competes with the Company's business within the geographic area in which the Company conducts its business, without the prior written consent of a Majority in Interest of the other Members. The parties acknowledge that California law generally restricts non-competition agreements and that the enforceability of this Section shall be determined in accordance with applicable California law.

**Section 20.2. Non-Solicitation.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Member agrees that, during the period in which such Member holds a Membership Interest in the Company and for a period of one (1) year following the cessation of such Member's membership, such Member shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, divert, or take away any customer, client, account, or business relationship of the Company that such Member had contact with or knowledge of during such Member's membership; or (b) solicit, recruit, or hire, or attempt to solicit, recruit, or hire, any employee, contractor, or consultant of the Company, or induce any such Person to leave the employ or engagement of the Company.

**Section 20.3. Reasonableness.** Each Member acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Article are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company and the other Members. Each Member further acknowledges that such Member has received adequate consideration for the obligations set forth in this Article, including the opportunity to participate in the business and profits of the Company.

**Section 20.4. Reformation.** If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Article is unreasonable, overly broad, or unenforceable for any reason, the parties intend that such court shall reform such provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable, rather than invalidate such provision in its entirety. The parties expressly acknowledge that any non-competition covenant herein shall be interpreted and enforced only to the extent permitted by applicable California law.

**Section 20.5. Remedies.** In the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Article, the Company shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in addition to any other damages to which the Company may be entitled. Each Member acknowledges that a breach of this Article would cause irreparable harm to the Company.

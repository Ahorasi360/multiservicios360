## ARTICLE XII — RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

**Section 12.1. Offer Notice.** If a Member (the "Offering Member") desires to Transfer all or any portion of such Member's Membership Interest to a bona fide third-party purchaser (the "Proposed Transferee"), the Offering Member shall first deliver a written notice (the "Offer Notice") to the Company and each other Member (each, a "Non-Offering Member"). The Offer Notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the Proposed Transferee; (b) the number and percentage of Membership Interests proposed to be Transferred; (c) the purchase price and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer; and (d) a copy of the bona fide written offer from the Proposed Transferee.

**Section 12.2. Company Option.** For a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of the Offer Notice (the "Company Option Period"), the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Membership Interests described in the Offer Notice at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as set forth therein. The Company shall exercise this right by delivering written notice of its election to the Offering Member within the Company Option Period.

**Section 12.3. Member Option.** If the Company does not elect to purchase all of the Offered Interests within the Company Option Period, each Non-Offering Member shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to purchase a pro rata share (based on such Non-Offering Member's Percentage Interest relative to the total Percentage Interests held by all Non-Offering Members) of the Offered Interests at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Offer Notice. Each Non-Offering Member desiring to exercise this right shall deliver written notice to the Offering Member within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the Company Option Period (the "Member Option Period").

**Section 12.4. Over-Allotment Right.** If any Non-Offering Member does not elect to purchase its full pro rata share, the remaining Offered Interests shall be allocated among the Non-Offering Members who elected to purchase and who indicated a desire to purchase additional Offered Interests, in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests, until all Offered Interests have been allocated or no Non-Offering Member desires to purchase additional Offered Interests.

**Section 12.5. Closing.** The closing of any purchase pursuant to this Article shall take place within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Member Option Period (or such later date as the parties may agree).

**Section 12.6. Sale to Proposed Transferee.** If the Company and the Non-Offering Members do not elect to purchase all of the Offered Interests, the Offering Member shall be free, for a period of ninety (90) days following the expiration of the Member Option Period, to Transfer the Offered Interests to the Proposed Transferee at a price and on terms no more favorable to the Proposed Transferee than those set forth in the Offer Notice and subject to the other conditions of Transfer set forth in this Agreement. If the Transfer is not completed within such ninety (90) day period, the Offered Interests shall once again be subject to the right of first refusal provisions of this Article.

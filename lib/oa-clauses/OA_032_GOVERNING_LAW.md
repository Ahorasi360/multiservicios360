**Section 29.1. Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, including the Act, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.

**Section 29.2. Jurisdiction and Venue.** Subject to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in this Agreement, each Member irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the County of {{venue_county}}, State of California, for the purpose of any suit, action, or other judicial proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each Member irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court, and any claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

## ARTICLE XXVI — SPOUSAL AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY CONSENT

**Section 26.1. Community Property Acknowledgment.** Each Member who is married or in a registered domestic partnership acknowledges that such Member's Membership Interest may constitute community property under California law. Each such Member agrees to obtain from such Member's spouse or registered domestic partner (collectively, "Spouse") a written consent in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement (the "Spousal Consent"), pursuant to which the Spouse acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the terms and restrictions of this Agreement as they relate to the Member's Membership Interest.

**Section 26.2. Spousal Consent Terms.** The Spousal Consent shall provide that the Spouse: (a) has read and understands this Agreement; (b) agrees to be bound by all restrictions on Transfer set forth in this Agreement; (c) consents to all provisions regarding buy-sell, right of first refusal, and other Transfer restrictions applicable to the Member's Membership Interest; (d) agrees that in the event of a dissolution of marriage or domestic partnership, such Spouse shall not seek to become a Member or to acquire any direct interest in the Company; and (e) acknowledges that the Spouse's community property interest, if any, in the Member's Membership Interest is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

**Section 26.3. Failure to Obtain Consent.** A Member's failure to obtain a Spousal Consent shall not invalidate this Agreement or such Member's obligations hereunder but may constitute a breach of this Agreement for which the non-compliant Member shall be liable to the Company and the other Members. The {{management_reference}} may require a Member to obtain a Spousal Consent as a condition to admission or continued membership.

**Section 26.4. Future Marriage.** If any Member marries or enters into a registered domestic partnership after the effective date of this Agreement, such Member shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a Spousal Consent from such Member's new Spouse within thirty (30) days of the marriage or registration.

**Section 26.5. Divorce or Dissolution.** In the event of the divorce or dissolution of a domestic partnership of any Member, the Company and the other Members shall have a right of first refusal with respect to any Membership Interest or portion thereof that is awarded or transferred to the Member's former Spouse, in accordance with the Transfer provisions of this Agreement. Any such Transfer shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

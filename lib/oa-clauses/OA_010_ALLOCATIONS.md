## ARTICLE VIII — ALLOCATIONS OF PROFIT AND LOSS

**Section 8.1. Net Profits and Net Losses.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, for each Fiscal Year (or portion thereof), net profits and net losses of the Company (and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit) shall be allocated among the Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.

**Section 8.2. Regulatory Allocations.** The following special allocations shall be made in the following order of priority:

**(a) Minimum Gain Chargeback.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if there is a net decrease in the Company's minimum gain (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(2)) during any Fiscal Year, each Member shall receive a special allocation of items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Company minimum gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g). This Section is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

**(b) Member Minimum Gain Chargeback.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (except Section 8.2(a)), if there is a net decrease in Member minimum gain attributable to a Member nonrecourse debt (as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4)) during any Fiscal Year, each Member who has a share of the Member minimum gain attributable to such Member nonrecourse debt shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Member minimum gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4). This Section is intended to comply with the partner minimum gain chargeback requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

**(c) Qualified Income Offset.** If any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustment, allocation, or distribution described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6) that causes or increases a deficit balance in such Member's Capital Account, items of Company income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, such deficit balance as quickly as possible.

**(d) Nonrecourse Deductions.** Nonrecourse deductions (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(1)) for any Fiscal Year shall be allocated among the Members in proportion to their Percentage Interests.

**(e) Member Nonrecourse Deductions.** Any Member nonrecourse deductions (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(1)) for any Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Member nonrecourse debt to which such deductions are attributable, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(1).

**Section 8.3. Tax Allocations.** For federal, state, and local income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of the Company shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as the corresponding items are allocated for Capital Account purposes under this Agreement, except as otherwise required by Section 704(c) of the Code or Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4). Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall be made by the {{management_reference}} in a manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement.

**Section 8.4. Allocations Upon Transfer.** If any Membership Interest is Transferred during a Fiscal Year, the net profits and net losses attributable to such Membership Interest for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated between the transferor and the transferee using any method permitted under Section 706(d) of the Code as determined by the {{management_reference}}.

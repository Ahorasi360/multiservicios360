## ARTICLE XXV — DEADLOCK RESOLUTION

**Section 25.1. Definition of Deadlock.** A "Deadlock" shall be deemed to exist when: (a) the Members are unable, after good faith efforts over a period of thirty (30) days, to agree on a matter that requires the approval of a Majority in Interest or unanimous consent of the Members; and (b) such inability to agree materially impairs the Company's ability to conduct its business or to take action on a matter of material importance to the Company. A Deadlock shall not be deemed to exist with respect to routine operational matters that can be deferred without material harm to the Company.

**Section 25.2. Notice of Deadlock.** Any Member may initiate the Deadlock resolution process by delivering written notice to all other Members (the "Deadlock Notice"). The Deadlock Notice shall describe in reasonable detail: (a) the matter on which the Members are unable to agree; (b) the position of the notifying Member with respect to such matter; and (c) the efforts that have been made to resolve the disagreement.

**Section 25.3. Senior Executive Negotiation.** Within fifteen (15) days following delivery of the Deadlock Notice, the Members shall meet (in person or by videoconference) and engage in good faith negotiations to resolve the Deadlock. Each Member may designate a senior advisor, accountant, or attorney to participate in such negotiations on behalf of such Member. The parties shall negotiate for a period of not less than fifteen (15) days before invoking any further resolution procedures.

**Section 25.4. Mediation.** If the Deadlock is not resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Deadlock Notice, either Member may submit the Deadlock to mediation in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of this Agreement. The mediator shall have experience with business disputes involving closely held companies.

**Section 25.5. Buy-Sell Option.** If the Deadlock is not resolved through negotiation or mediation within ninety (90) days following delivery of the Deadlock Notice, either Member (the "Initiating Member") may invoke the buy-sell mechanism set forth in this Section by delivering a written offer (the "Buy-Sell Notice") to the other Member (the "Responding Member") that specifies a total valuation of the Company (the "Offered Value").

**(a)** Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Buy-Sell Notice, the Responding Member shall elect, by written notice to the Initiating Member, either to: (i) purchase the Initiating Member's entire Membership Interest at a price equal to the Initiating Member's Percentage Interest multiplied by the Offered Value; or (ii) sell the Responding Member's entire Membership Interest to the Initiating Member at a price equal to the Responding Member's Percentage Interest multiplied by the Offered Value.

**(b)** If the Responding Member fails to deliver a timely election, the Responding Member shall be deemed to have elected to sell the Responding Member's Membership Interest to the Initiating Member at the price calculated in accordance with clause (a)(ii) above.

**(c)** The closing of any purchase or sale pursuant to this Section shall take place within sixty (60) days following the Responding Member's election (or deemed election).

**(d)** The purchasing Member may pay the purchase price in cash at closing or, if the purchasing Member demonstrates an inability to pay the full amount at closing, in up to twelve (12) equal monthly installments secured by a promissory note bearing interest at the applicable federal rate.

**Section 25.6. Dissolution as Last Resort.** If neither Member invokes the buy-sell mechanism within one hundred twenty (120) days following delivery of the Deadlock Notice, and the Deadlock remains unresolved, either Member may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial dissolution of the Company under Section 17707.03 of the Act.

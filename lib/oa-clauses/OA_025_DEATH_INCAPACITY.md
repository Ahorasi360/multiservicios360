## ARTICLE XXII — DEATH OR INCAPACITY OF A MEMBER

**Section 22.1. Death of a Member.** Upon the death of a Member (the "Deceased Member"), the Company shall not dissolve, and the Company's business shall continue without interruption. The Deceased Member's Membership Interest shall pass to such Deceased Member's estate, heirs, or designated beneficiaries (collectively, the "Successor") in accordance with the Deceased Member's will, trust, or applicable intestacy laws. The Successor shall be entitled to receive the Deceased Member's share of allocations and distributions from the Company but shall not be admitted as a Member of the Company with governance and voting rights unless and until: (a) the Successor satisfies the requirements for admission of new Members as set forth in this Agreement; and (b) a Majority in Interest of the remaining Members consents in writing to such admission, which consent may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of such Members.

**Section 22.2. Rights of Successor Pending Admission.** Until a Successor is admitted as a Member, the Successor shall be treated as an assignee of the Deceased Member's economic interest only. The Successor shall have no right to participate in the management or affairs of the Company, no right to vote on any matter, and no right to access Confidential Information beyond what is required by the Act. The Successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as the Deceased Member.

**Section 22.3. Incapacity of a Member.** In the event a Member becomes permanently incapacitated (meaning the inability, due to physical or mental impairment, to manage such Member's personal affairs for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, as certified by a licensed physician), the guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of such Member shall have the rights of an assignee of such Member's economic interest and may exercise such Member's governance rights only to the extent authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction. The remaining Members shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the incapacitated Member's Membership Interest at fair market value as determined in good faith by the {{management_reference}}.

**Section 22.4. Purchase Option.** Upon the death or permanent incapacity of a Member, the remaining Members shall have the option, exercisable within ninety (90) days of the date of death or determination of permanent incapacity, to purchase all of the Deceased or incapacitated Member's Membership Interest at fair market value. If more than one remaining Member elects to exercise this option, the Membership Interest shall be allocated among the purchasing Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests (or as they may otherwise agree). Fair market value shall be determined by mutual agreement of the parties or, if they cannot agree within thirty (30) days, by an independent appraiser selected by the {{management_reference}}.

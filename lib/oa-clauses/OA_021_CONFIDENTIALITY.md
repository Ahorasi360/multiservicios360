## ARTICLE XIX — CONFIDENTIALITY

**Section 19.1. Confidential Information.** Each Member acknowledges that, in the course of such Member's association with the Company, such Member will have access to and become acquainted with confidential and proprietary information belonging to the Company (collectively, "Confidential Information"). Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to: (a) trade secrets, inventions, processes, formulas, and know-how; (b) customer lists, customer information, and business relationships; (c) financial information, projections, and business plans; (d) marketing strategies and pricing information; (e) the terms of this Agreement; and (f) any other information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known to the public or to other Persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.

**Section 19.2. Non-Disclosure Obligation.** Each Member agrees that, during the term of such Member's membership in the Company and for a period of two (2) years following such Member's withdrawal, resignation, removal, or other cessation of membership, such Member shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) disclose any Confidential Information to any Person not authorized by the {{management_reference}} to receive such information; (b) use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the conduct of the Company's business; or (c) remove or copy any Confidential Information from the Company's premises, except as necessary for the conduct of the Company's business.

**Section 19.3. Exceptions.** The obligations set forth in this Article shall not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the receiving Member; (b) was known to the receiving Member prior to its disclosure by the Company; (c) is independently developed by the receiving Member without reference to Confidential Information; (d) is disclosed with the prior written consent of the {{management_reference}}; or (e) is required to be disclosed by applicable law, regulation, or court order, provided that the disclosing Member provides prompt written notice to the Company and reasonably cooperates with the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

**Section 19.4. Return of Materials.** Upon the withdrawal, resignation, removal, or other cessation of a Member's membership, or at any time upon request by the {{management_reference}}, such Member shall promptly return to the Company all documents, records, files, and other materials containing Confidential Information, and shall not retain any copies, extracts, or summaries thereof.

**Section 19.5. Remedies.** Each Member acknowledges that a breach of this Article would cause irreparable harm to the Company for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable remedies in the event of any threatened or actual breach of this Article, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security.
